1. Visitors approach to the hacked lucky draw machine.

  The hacked lucky draw machine has three parts :
    a. main computing system - populated with randomwalks page embedded google plus button.
    b. lucky draw machine with a hanging pliers.
    c. transparent monitor (on the lucky draw machine frontal window) populated with collected DATA visualization. 
 
2. Visitors can "plus" with their google account on the installed computer.
3. Once they "plus", one free draw will be given to a new supporter.
4. Pick one of items in the hacked lucky draw machine by using the installed big pliers.
5. Visualization of daily plus number and user increment with taken item kinds will be displayed on the installed transparent monitor of frontal window of the hacked lucky draw machine.

#### response scenario:
1. how can we engage new followers/circle friends to randomwalks in long term perspective?
2. how can we define which one is "support" or "a coin"?
