####interaction scenario:

![interaction wireframe](https://raw.github.com/randomwalks/devart-template/master/project_images/drawmachine_wireFrame.jpg "interaction wireFrame")

1. Visitors approach to the hacked lucky draw machine.

  The hacked lucky draw machine has three parts :
    a. main computing system - populated with randomwalks google plus page
    b. lucky draw machine with a hanging pliers.
    c. transparent monitor (on the lucky draw manchine frontal window) populated with collected DATA 
 
2. Visitors can "plus" or "follow" (we are still figuring out getting a list of followers API is available or not) randomwalks with their google account on the installed computer.
3. Once they "plus", one free draw will be given to a new supporter.
4. Pick one of items in the hacked lucky draw machine by using the installed big pliers.
5. Visualization of daily followers increasement with taken item kinds will be displayed on the installed transparent monitor of frontal window of the hacked lucky draw machine. We will use a ready made transparent monitor.

#### response scenario:
1. how can we engage new followers to randomwalks in long term perspective?
2. how can we define which one is "support" or "a coin"?
