#### visualizing scenario omn the secondary monitor

1. a new follower
2. followers occuring pattern over time
4. taken gifts kinds by followers

data influence factors
1. quality of randomwalksâ€™ previous projects / activities - are they valuable enough to follow?

1. timeline loops over and over during idle.
2. exhibition days special issue indication : weekday/weekend/holidays
3. entire exhibition timeline will be shown on back side.
4. each day has its own window containing the day's followers, taken items, etc. Focused day has a larger window than the rest. Due to safe rendering, multi-windows will be limited 5 (or more).

key functions : webGL, multi-window, communicating between windows. dropping a specific day related information to a right window.
