2. exhibition days special issue indication : weekday/weekend/holidays
3. entire exhibition timeline will be shown on back side.
4. each day has its own window containing the day's followers, taken items, etc. Focused day has a larger window than the rest. Due to safe rendering, multi-windows will be limited 5 (or more).

key functions : webGL, multi-window, communicating between windows. dropping a specific day related information to a right window.
