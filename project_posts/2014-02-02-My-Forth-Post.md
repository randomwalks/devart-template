### post_04: hardware plan


#### lucky draw machine hacking plan

When a visitor follows  randomwalks google plus page on the installed computer,

1. a digital signal will be sent to an arduino board.
2. When an arduino board gets input data (“new follower came”), it sends a signal to a lucky draw machine system to generate one free play for the follower.
3. A follower can play with pickers of a lucky draw machine to get one of items.
4. Each gift has a pre-set RFID information including item kind.
5. RFID reader is installed at the bottom of a lucky draw machine, which can detect
  a) what kinds of gifts are going out and
  b) send a signal to an arduino board, which will send a signal back to a local computer database system.
