## Description
Social media exchange (buying and selling online popularity) becomes a huge part of social media marketing industry. Online services where you can sell and buy  your “like” or “plus” are increasing dramatically, and as a result, companies or products can build their market reputation unnaturally with those numbers. This manipulated numbers (popularity data) create a beneficial effect on SEO (Search Engine Optimization), which would attract potential consumers’ prejudgement.

This project, "<strong>DATA Currency : <i>valuable support or a piece of coin? </i></strong>"</style> is questioning to visitors about what SNS supporting activity does mean today. The installation presents a hacked lucky draw machine with a connected computing system. The installed computer monitor will be populated with randomwalks’ web page included google plus button and visitors are able to “plus” it after reviewing the page contents. Once visitors does “plus”, they receive one free draw for a lucky draw machine. Visitors might give a “plus” because they truly support randomwalks efforts and experiments or they just do that because of to get one of the gifts in the lucky draw machine. After getting "plus" from visitors, we will compare this number to randomwalks google plus page followers or circle friends increasement. 

Data becomes a new form of currency in terms of online activities. People make positive responses through SNS, which creates remarkable fames and influences online and offiline. This phenomena affects marketing system, so “click farms” became a new source of data manipulation. However, buying popularity can’t be last. It might help to a short time attraction happening, but long term reputation occurs only with good contents. 

Of course, randomwalks appreciates every single given “plus” even it means nothing but a coin.

#### DATA currencty : network activities
This proposal is a part of our series work of "data currency". First project of series is "data currency : network activity", which questionling how we can measure our labors of network activities. A customized hybrid table (computing system with knitting machine) generates power to run the installed kintting machine while visitors can do google search. The amount of generated power isepending on values of searched keywords.
