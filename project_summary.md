## Description
Social exchange (buying and selling online popularity) becomes a huge part of social media marketing industry. Online services where you can sell and buy  your “like” or “plus” are increasing dramatically, and as a result, certain companies or products can build their reputation unnaturally with those numbers. This manipulated numbers (popularity data) create a beneficial effect on SEO (Search Engine Optimization), which would attract  potential consumers’ prejudgement.

This project, "<strong>DATA Currency : <i>valuable support or a piece of coin? </i></strong>"</style> questions to visitors about what SNS supporting activity means today. The installation presents a lucky draw machine connected to a computing system. The installed computer monitor will be populated with randomwalks’ google plus page and visitors are able to give a “plus” after reviewing randomwalks’ previous projects and activities. Once visitors make a “plus”, they receive one free draw. Visitors might give a “plus” because they truly support randomwalks efforts and experiments or they just do that because of to get one of the prepared presents filled up in the lucky draw machine. Value of supporting action will be defined depending on why visitors make a “plus”. It can be a thankful support or a piece of coin. 

Data becomes a new form of currency in terms of online activities. People make positive responses through SNS, which creates remarkable fames and influences. This phenomena affects marketing system, so “click farms” became a new source of data manipulation. However, buying popularity can’t be last. It might help to a short time attraction happening, but long term reputation occurs only with good contents. 

Of course, randomwalks appreciates every single given “plus” even it means nothing but a coin.
